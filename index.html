        <p>We are in this business for 20 years and our main motive is to help children in their studies by providing
            them books, notebooks, pens and many other things so as to assure them that there is no hindrance in their
            studies. We help poor children by providing all of this stationery for free. We have got different schemes
            for children coming from different background. We have stores in 20+ states in India and counting. We have
            got around 5,00,000 users and this number is increasing day by day. When we had started this shop we didn't
            know that this is going to be huge business. We have strongly believed on feedback from the customers
            because you guys help us improve our service and product quality. </p>
