        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>
            Hello Friends! My name is Madhav Mishra, I am 19 years old. I have done my schooling from City Montessori
            School which is situated in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India and I am pursuing my degree of Bachelor Of
            Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Amity University situated in Lucknow. I aspire to become
            the fantastic software developer. My insipration was technology changed through time. I mean changing of
            user interface through the years from Windows 3.1 to Windows 11 we have come a long way same goes for
            Android and iOS mobile operating systems. When I was a toddler I used to see my father and uncle work on
            computer which made me fascinated. Recently, I watched The Social Network directed by David Fincher and The
            Social Dilemma which opened a new door for me and it gave me an reality check how hard I have to work to
            reach my goal! My hobbies are watching movies, listening music and read some books. Currently, I am reading
            Shoe Dog written by Phil Knight.
